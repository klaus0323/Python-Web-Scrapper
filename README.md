PriceGrabber
============
PriceGrabber is a solo python project that enables the user to compare the price on different websites (such as amazon, bestbuy, and newegg) across the same product. 

This is a Python package to retrieve prices for specific products from all sorts of websites, such as Amazon, Aliexpress, or price comparison websites. The main teck stacks and frameworks used are: Scrapy, Scraper API, Beautiful Soup, Requests, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

The scrapper also provides users with personalized data over different websites using GraphQL.

New websites can be supported by means of a simple configuration entry. Currently supported sites include:

* Amazon.(de, com, co.uk, ca, probably all)
* Newegg.com
* Aliexpress.com
* Bestbuy.com

Usage
-----

Usage is pretty simple. Mostly you should be able to put in an URL to the site of a product you're interested in, and you should get out a price (or a list of prices). Here is an Example for an AliExpress product:

```python
>>> from pricegrabber import Grabber
>>> cfg = {"url": "https://de.aliexpress.com/store/product/Cherry-cherry-shaft-shaft-mx-mechanical-keyboard-shaft-switch-black-shaft-tea-shaft-white-shaft-green/2230037_32682571027.html?spm=a2g0x.12010612.8148356.2.75987786TNUZUO"}
>>> g = Grabber(cfg)
>>> g.grab()
[(8.9, '$')]
```

So in this case we know that the pack of Cherry MX key switches from AliExpress costs $8,90. Note that a list is returned. Some sites may report multiple prices instead of just one.

The final result will be demonstrated through bar chart (or line chart under some occasion)ï¼Œone demonstration of the result demonstration looks like below:

This is my first solo project, and I know there are many things to be improved. But hey, that's how things start.
